# Q1 commentary
## About Q1
- In this question we need to make two methods.
- simulateOneDay method changes the amoiunt of food left, it randomly generates the amount of food each bird will eat and 5% chance a bear will eat all of it.
- simulateManyDays method returns the number of days bear or birds are found at the feeder using the simulateOneDay method.
## Struggles
- didn't understand how to create the 5% randomly bear chance.
## expereience helped 
- last minutes review on Math.random even though messed up on the 5% chance.
## What I learned
- i learn how diffcult Math.random is sometimes
